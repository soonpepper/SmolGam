Welcome to my game! 

If you've reached this text file, that means that you're smarter
than you give yourself credit for-

Use the arrow keys to move, press Z to jump.

Since you're here, might as well give you a clue into what you're
supposed to do.

Think outside the box.

~~~

> Not for the player to read past this point <
If the user clicks outside the box, then a word starts to appear
the more they click on the squares, the more of the word 
appears

Which is Memento Mori.

Once this word is revealed, a pixel art of the depression game 
pops up.

In which, the player can smoke a cigarette and go through
the visual novel.

There is a pain meter, and once the pain level reaches the max
there's a game over screen, the user can never play the game again

This goes through my psychosis. 
First I'll write the events that happens, and input it into the book
Second I'll translate this into the game events-
After that I'll add more things to it, like a sex button in relation
to my relationship with Fania. 

I'll add more as I think of them.
